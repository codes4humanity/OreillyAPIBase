# oreilly-search

The learning.oreilly.com has a lot of online trainings listed and they all hosted on the event.on24.com platform.
But because of this you only have limited search abilities on the oreilly platfom. You can search for events in the next 7, 60 or 180 days, without using any search string, so this is more like a browse all content.

And if you want to search for example for "Python" then you get the result, but then you can't sort for starting date, time and this makes it really hard to choose something for a set of free period you have.

The oreilly.py will help in creating a list with a search string in an ordered fashion, from which I can easily choose from for a specified date.
